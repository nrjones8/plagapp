S'I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by\nsociety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing\narbitrary or unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly done. It\ncan and should be done with a full and scrupulous regard for the interests\nand liberties of all concerned as well as for the permanent interests of\nsociety itself.'

S'Three matters of capital importance await the action of the Senate which\nhave already been acted upon by the House of Representatives; the bill\nwhich seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in\npromoting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some\nto be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; the bill amending\nthe present organic law of Porto Rico; and the bill proposing a more\nthorough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in\nelections, commonly called the Corrupt Practices Act.'

S'I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their\nurgency lies in the manifest circumstances which render their adoption at\nthis time not only opportune but necessary. Even delay would seriously\njeopard the interests of the country and of the Government.'

S'Immediate passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in\nelections may seem to be less necessary than the immediate enactment of the\nother measures to which I refer, because at least two years will elapse\nbefore another election in which Federal offices are to be filled; but it\nwould greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt\nwith while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the\npresent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under\nrecent observation, and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied\nin the light of present experience; and a delay would have the further very\nserious disadvantage of postponing action until another election was at\nhand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in\nthe mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for\nguidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose.'

S'I shall not argue at length the desirability of giving a freer hand in the\nmatter of combined and concerted effort to those who shall undertake the\nessential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will\npresently, will immediately assume, has indeed already assumed a magnitude\nunprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessary\ninstrumentalities for its prosecution; it is deemed to be doubtful whether\nthey could be created upon an adequate scale under our present laws.'
