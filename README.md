Front end for plag detection. See the wiki to get started:

Some other resources I started off with:
  * Flask (there are a ton of tutorials out there, but this one has a lot: http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
  * Bootstrap (which all the styling is based on right now: http://ryaneshea.com/lightweight-python-apps-with-flask-twitter-bootstrap-and-heroku)
  * Heroku, for easy deployment later on? (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)
